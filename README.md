# YouTube_Analyzer
This project is a YouTube Comment Sentiment Analyzer, built to automatically fetch comments from any YouTube video URL and perform sentiment analysis on them. It uses the Google YouTube Data API to fetch comments, Hugging Face‚Äôs transformer models for sentiment classification, and Gradio for an easy-to-use interface. The tool processes the text and emojis in the comments to classify the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. title: YouTube Analyzer emoji: üèÜ colorFrom: purple colorTo: yellow sdk: gradio sdk_version: 5.24.0 app_file: app.py pinned: false
